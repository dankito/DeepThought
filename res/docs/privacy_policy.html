		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Except for Beta and Alpha testers: We do not collect any data at all.<br/>
			None of your stored data, no user statistics, simply nothing.<br/>
			We even don't have any web services where we could send data to. (Always be aware, companies offering you cloud storage, which is quite expensive, will have to regain their money somehow with your data.)
		</p>
		<p>Only for Beta and Alpha testers: With an analytics tool we are collecting these data:<br/>
			Which device and Android version you are running on, application logs, session times, memory and cpu usage and in some cases screen recordings(!) of our app usage.
