DeepThought assists you in cataloging knowledge: from interesting facts to own notes, excerpts, recipes or websites. Through a powerful full-text search, you can quickly find your entries. Alternatively, you can give your entries own tags.

For Newsjunkies, the app also includes an RSS feed, with which you can conveniently save items for later read, even without an Internet connection.
