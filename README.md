# DeepThought #

A knowledge management system to easily store and quickly re-find all your data.

Data retrieval is done via the integrated full text search engine or Tags you add to your entries.

Data sources can be such as manual text input, websites with automatic web page extraction, Apps that have share functionality or
books and newspapers with offline text recognition (if OCR Android App [TextFairy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.renard.ocr) is installed).

You can sync your data between all your devices, e.g. your Android device and your Laptop. Data added on your Android will then automatically
be synchronized to your Laptop as soon as they are in the same local network.
